# Playwright Automation Testing (TypeScript)

This repository contains Playwright automation tests written in TypeScript, demonstrating multiple approaches to testing web applications.

## What this project covers

1. Predefined Playwright Locators  
   Usage of built-in locators such as `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`, and `getByPlaceholder`.

2. Custom Locators  
   Testing using locators like CSS selectors, ID, and ARIA attributes (for example, `aria-label`).

3. Advanced Locator Handling  
   Handling strict mode violations, refining locators to uniquely identify elements, and working with multiple matching elements.

## Test Scenarios
- Login functionality testing  
- Page navigation and URL validation  
- Visibility and text assertions  
- Form input validation  

## Technology Stack
- Playwright  
- TypeScript  
- Node.js  

## Purpose
This repository serves as a learning and practice reference for understanding Playwright locators and building stable, maintainable automation tests for web applications using TypeScript.
